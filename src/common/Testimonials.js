                            Weight loss is a part of my motivation to eat right but it's not the only reason that I am doing this. For me, it's about being healthier. Eating what my body really needs keeps me from being tempted to eat the wrong thing. And fortunately, with the combination of eating right, exercising and generally trying to be healthier, I've also lost weight.‚Äù
